# LinkedIn PYMK Filter

LinkedIn's [People You May Know](https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk) page is a handy tool for finding and connecting with people in your network. If you imported your contacts to LinkedIn from external sources however, LinkedIn will include non-members on this page. The design can be deceiving because the only distinguishing feature for contact cards on the page is the button text: "Add to network" versus "Connect". This extension will simply disable those cards to prevent you from accidentally sending an invite to your contacts to join your network on LinkedIn.
