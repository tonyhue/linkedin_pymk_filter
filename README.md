# LinkedIn PYMK Filter

> I can't believe it. I have 15 million friends on Facebook, 29 million followers on Twitter, and 45 million email requests to join LinkedIn.

LinkedIn's [People You May Know](https://www.linkedin.com/people/pymk) page is a handy tool for finding and connecting with your network. 

If you imported your contacts to LinkedIn from external sources however, LinkedIn will include non-members on this page. The design can be deceiving because the only distinguishing feature for non-members is that the headline is replaced by the phrase "Invite to join LinkedIn" and the contact's email address. 

This extension will simply disable those cards to prevent you from accidentally sending an invite to your contacts to join your network on LinkedIn.
